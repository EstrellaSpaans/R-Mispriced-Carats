In this basic project I learned how to import data, install a package (ggplot2), visualized a plot, and gathered some quick insights. 

1. First we imported the data. 
1. Then we installed the "ggplot2" package to do visualizations. 
1. It was time to visualize a basic scatterplot. 
1. In order to get clearer insights, I adjusted the scatterplot. 
1. Lastely, gathered some basic insights from the plot.
